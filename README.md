## The mod authors and modification are in no affiliation with ABI and not supported by ABI.
Mods I have created for ChilloutVR. 
I'll add more eventually  
I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing, please be kind.  
  
## Beautify particles:  
Beautify particles is a mod that sets all particles to face the camera, as well as locking their roll axis. This makes particles much more realistic in VR.
